"""Audio recording module using PipeWire/PulseAudio via pactl/pw-record/parec.

Design notes
------------
- We address devices by *name* (e.g. ``alsa_input.pci-...analog-stereo``)
  rather than by numeric index. Indexes change every time PipeWire restarts;
  names are stable across reboots.
- For system audio we record from a **source** named ``<sink-name>.monitor``,
  which both ``pw-record --target=...`` and ``parec --device=...`` accept.
  This replaces the previous code that tried to pass a sink *index* as a
  monitor target — that only worked accidentally on some systems.
- After ``Popen`` we poll briefly to detect immediate exits (bad device, busy
  device, missing tool) and surface them as a regular ``RuntimeError`` so the
  app's recording state never gets stuck "recording" with no real process.
- ``cancel_recording()`` is distinct from ``stop_recording()``: it kills the
  capture processes and deletes both temp files and the final WAV without
  invoking ffmpeg.

    streams sharing the sink — exactly the failure mode James observed
    (system leg captured at 1% while the live meter saw 24%).

    The fix: hold the sink awake by attaching a *reader* to its monitor
    via ``parec``, discarding samples to /dev/null. This doesn't inject
    anything into the audio graph; it just registers as an interested
    monitor consumer so PipeWire keeps the sink alive. The recorder's
    own ``pw-record`` reader is independent.

    Returns the Popen handle so the caller can terminate it at stop time,
    or None if no suitable tool is available / sink isn't known.

        Tool selection is target-dependent because of a real-world quirk

        - ``pw-record --target=<sink>.monitor`` captures the monitor at
          a level **45 dB quieter** than ``parec --device=<sink>.monitor``
          on the same hardware, same instant, same audio. Reproduced
          deterministically: pw-record gave -52 dBFS peak, parec gave
          -7 dBFS peak.
        - For ordinary microphone sources, both tools capture at correct
          levels, but pw-record handles target= more reliably (parec on
          some setups needs --device pointing at the raw ALSA name, not
          a WirePlumber loopback filter).

        So: for ``.monitor`` sources we prefer ``parec``; for everything
        else we prefer ``pw-record``. Both fall back to the other if the
        preferred tool is missing.

        parec is always invoked with ``--file-format=wav`` so the
        resulting file is a real WAV container, not raw PCM with a
