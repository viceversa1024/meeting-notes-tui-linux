"""Tests for the adaptive mix-gain logic in AudioRecorder.

The big real-world bug James hit: mic captured at 15% peak, system audio
captured at 1% peak (the Scarlett's sink monitor emits low-level signal
by default). Fixed 2.0× gain on each leg meant his voice dominated the
mix entirely. The fix: measure each leg's peak before mixing and apply
per-leg gain so both land near 50%.
